# Neovim Lua Configuration

This is my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration.
It will probably always be a work in progress.
The plugin manager is [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
I'm probably doing things in a suboptimal way.
Still, feel free to use it as inspiration for your own config!
